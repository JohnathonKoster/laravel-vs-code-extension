# Contributing

To get the extension running locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/laravel/vs-code-extension.git
cd vs-code-extension
npm install
```

-   Open the project in VS Code
-   Open the command palette and search for "Debug: Start Debugging"
-   A new VS Code window will open, you'll see "[Extension Development Host]" in the title
-   Open any folder you'd like to test against
-   Press `âŒ˜ + R` to reload the Extension Development Host project and see changes

## Of Note

-   `console.log` will appear in your main VS Code "Debug Console" tab, _not_ the Extension Development Host window
-   `info`, `error`, etc from `src/support/logger.ts` will show up in the "Output" tab (make sure to select "Laravel" from the list) of your Extension Development Host window

## Testing the Parser

The [PHP parser](https://github.com/laravel/vs-code-php-parser-cli) is a standalone binary that parses the PHP scripts for item detection and autocomplete.

If you are making changes to the parser, follow the setup instructions from that repo and create an `.env` file at the root of the `vs-code-extension` with the full path to this variable set:

`PHP_PARSER_BINARY_PATH=[FULL PATH TO DIRECTORY]/vs-code-php-parser-cli/php-parser`

If you make changes to your `.env` file, you'll have to close the Extension Development Host and start debugging again.
